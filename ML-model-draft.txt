US Federal Campaign Finance data 1990-2016
Machine Learning Model Outline

• Overview - Machine Learning will be applied to this data set to address our main problem statement:  Predict a winner in a political race based on selected features from the data. We will be testing and comparing different models to see which performs the best in terms of accuracy and best fit.

MODELS:
	Supervised:
		•Random Forest Classifier
		•Logistic Regression
		•Neural Network (likely too complex for this situation).

	Un-Supervised:
		•KMEANS Clustering

PREPROCESSING:
	Cleaning and encoding categorical variables.  Bucketing rare values may be necessary.  PCA for Clustering.  Scaling/Standardizing. Joining Candidates to PACS table as to include features from two tables.  It's also worth mentioning that we may decide to select only the most recent years, 2000-2016, due to inflation devaluing money and including most relevant data.

FEATURES:
	c.party
	c.dist_id_run_for
	c.CRPICO
	c.NOPACS	
	c.raised_from_pacs
	c.raised_from_individuals
	c.raised_total
	c.raised_unitemized
	p.pacid
	p.Amount
	p.type

TARGET:
	c.result - 1:W, 0:L

RESULT:
	Hopefully, our supervised models will provide us with accurate predictions for election results.  Our un-supervised approach may help us group candidates based on fiscal activity and help better understand the politics and power play.


Notes: States can make an impact and maybe we should include???????
