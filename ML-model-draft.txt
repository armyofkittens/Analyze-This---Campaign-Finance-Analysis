Machine Learning Model Outline

• Overview - Machine Learning will be applied to this data set to address our main problem statement:  Predict a winner in a political race based on selected features from the data. We will be testing and comparing different models to see which performs the best in terms of accuracy and best fit.

MODELS:
	Supervised:
		•Random Forest Classifier
		•Logistic Regression
		•Neural Network (likely too complex for this situation).

	Un-Supervised:
		•KMEANS Clustering

PREPROCESSING:
	Cleaning and encoding categorical variables.  PCA for Clustering.  Scaling/Standardizing. Joining Candidates to PACS table as to include features from two tables.

FEATURES:
	c.party
	c.dist_id_run_for
	c.CRPICO
	c.NOPACS	
	c.raised_from_pacs
	c.raised_from_individuals
	c.raised_total
	c.raised_unitemized
	p.pacid
	p.Amount
	p.type

TARGET:
	c.result - 1:W, 0:L
