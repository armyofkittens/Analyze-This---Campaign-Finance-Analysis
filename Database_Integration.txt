Database Integration



In this project we will be utilizing a data set of Kaggle that contains data from campaign finance data starting in 1990. The data is originally sourced from the website OpenSecrets, a reputable nonpartisan, independent, and nonprofit organization that has been in operation since 1996. We have access to a handful of different data sets through Kaggle including candidates, backer information, committee information, pac information and more that we will be tying together via common keys such as candidate ID with SQL. We will accomplish this through inner joins on candidate ID, and create new tables with the information needed, so that we can analyze the election results based on financial support.




We will be using Postgres SQL to create the connections through out are data and put together a cohesive and clear picture.
