Database Integration


In this project we will be utilizing a data set of Kaggle that contains data from campaign finance data starting in 1990. We have access to a handful of different data sets through Kaggle including candidates, backer information, committee information, pac information and more that we will be tying together via common keys such as candidate ID with SQL. 


We will be using Postgres SQL to create the connections through out are data and put together a cohesive and clear picture.
