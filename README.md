# Analyze This! Campaign Finance Analysis

## Communication Protocols
Team "Analyze This!" has discussed our communication protocols and agreed to the following:
* We will be using Slack as our primary communication tool, using our own channel.
* We will meet no less than twice a week over Zoom to discuss the progress on our project.
* We will post a message into our Slack channel to discuss any emerging Pull Requests and to seek team approvals.
* Communicate any difficult life circumstances that may prevent us from completing a task into Slack so that we may jump in as a team to assist. 


## Machine Learning Model

## Database

In this project we will be utilizing a data set of Kaggle that contains data from campaign finance data starting in 1990. The data is originally sourced from the website OpenSecrets, a reputable nonpartisan, independent, and nonprofit organization that has been in operation since 1996. We have access to a handful of different data sets through Kaggle including candidates, backer information, committee information, pac information and more that we will be tying together via common keys such as candidate ID with SQL. We will accomplish this through inner joins on candidate ID, and create new tables with the information needed, so that we can analyze the election results based on financial support.


We will be using Postgres SQL to create the connections through out are data and put together a cohesive and clear picture.
