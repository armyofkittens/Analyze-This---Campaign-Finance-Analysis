# Analyze This! Campaign Finance Analysis
## Communication Protocols
Team "Analyze This!" has discussed our communication protocols and agreed to the following:
* We will be using Slack as our primary communication tool, using our own channel.
* We will meet no less than twice a week over Zoom to discuss the progress on our project.
* We will post a message into our Slack channel to discuss any emerging Pull Requests and to seek team approvals.
* Communicate any difficult life circumstances that may prevent us from completing a task into Slack so that we may jump in as a team to assist.
